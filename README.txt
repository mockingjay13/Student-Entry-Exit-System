Facial Recognition Based Student Entry/Exit System
**************************************************

This is a record maintenance system using Facial Recognition that captures real time image and compares with sample photos.

We faced an issue that anybody random could use anyone's enrollment number to exit and not return for many days causing a lot of unnecessary trouble for the person whose ID is used, which gave us an idea to develop a software which would take snapshots and compare it with existing photo from an existing collection of photographs. This would prevent any misuse of student IDs just by using enrollment number.

Python and its libraries like Face Recognition, OpenCV, Tkinter Pillow, Numpy are used to build this project.
